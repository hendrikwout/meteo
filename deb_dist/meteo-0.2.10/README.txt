Meteo is a library in development to work with meteorological data. It
currently has procedures for moisture variable conversions between relative
humidity, mixing ratio and specific humidity Please let me know if you want

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from meteo import *

    # calculate saturation pressure
    print(esat(282.15))
